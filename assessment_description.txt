for the assessment - one sybsystem and one command (command has to use joystick to control something and also a button will need to be used so button bindings will need to be known)

joystick.rightBumper()

mechanism will need to be made

difficulty is comparable to the arm command/subsystem
    - it's the arm + placing stuff from the arm
